When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
1. So I can access the repository from a different device if needed.
2. To save a copy of my work in the cloud as a backup in case my local repo's
   data is lost
3. To allow others to access my repository/make changes to the contents of my
   repository or project if I am working on a project in collaboration with 
   others. 
4. To have an online record of all projects I've worked on as a very
   rudimentary portfolio of sorts.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If Git were to sync my repositories automatically, it may make changes to my
local or remote repos that would undo changes I may have made since the last
sync. It is safer to manually pull changes instead because I will only 
pull changes when I am certain they will not affect the rest of the programme
in an undesirable way.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
